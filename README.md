# AsciiArt

Converts in image to ascii art in the terminal
images larger than 300x300 probably will not work as the terminal cannot zoom out far enough. 
Currently there is an issue with the images comming out sideways, this can be easily overcome by using an image manipulation program to rotate the image clockwise
90 degrees
